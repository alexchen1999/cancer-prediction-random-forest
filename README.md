# Random Forest Model to Predict Cancer Type Based on Gene Expression Data

This project trains a One vs. All Ensemble Learner of random forests using scikit-learn to predict cancer type. Created by following [Cancer Prediction using machine learning | Random Forests | Python Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzpL1ksWqtk&t=1520s)

The dataset is from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TGCA) project and is of RNA-seq gene expression data, randomly sampled from patients with different cancer types. 

## Results:

The higher performing of the two models achieved the following scores: 
- accuracy: 97.1%
- precision: 98.2%
- recall: 98.1%
- F1: 98.1%
